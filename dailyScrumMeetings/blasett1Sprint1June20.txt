What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Worked on Command and Validation classes and created subclasses for command 

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Finish up any additions to validation class that may be necessary
    - Look for any additional requirements for the generic command classes that can be inherited
    - Continue distributing tasks among my group members to implement the User Stories.

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Developing additional methods for generic command class to be inherited by all subclasses
