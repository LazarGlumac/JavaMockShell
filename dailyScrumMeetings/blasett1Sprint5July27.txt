What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Added additional comments
    - Made redirection functional for all output classes
    - Began Junit testing

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Continue testing code
    - Error handling

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Maybe implementing an interface for file/directory and whether its even neccesary
