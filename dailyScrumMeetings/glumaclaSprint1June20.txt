What did I work on in the last three days?
	- Worked on FileSystem, JShell, Directory, and UserTerminalInput classes
	- Begin a skeleton implementation of FileSystem and UserTerminalInput into the JShell class

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- Finish FileSystem and UserTerminalInput
	- Conintue implementing the design and rank the importance of what needs to be done in the next sprint

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Need to test the FileSystem functionality and ensure that data being read in the UserTerminalInput class is bugless
	- Need the Validation and Command class to be completed in order to integerate the UserTerminalInput class.
