What did I work on in the last three days?
	- Finished the checkPath method in FileSystem, fixing bugs and adding a check for files.
	- Tested the FileSystem class in a general way.
	= Added function to return the subdirectories of directory in the Directory class.

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- Start working on the mkdir command class.
	- Start working on the history command class.

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Cannot properly test the functionality of the FileSystem class without all of the commands which require it completed.
