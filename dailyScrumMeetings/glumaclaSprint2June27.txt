What did I work on in the last three days?
	- Tested and finished the History command with correct output.
	- Tested the implementation of the basic current functions the team has completed.
	= Finished an initial design and implementation of the Mkdir command, but have not tested completely.
	- Made minor changes to the FileSystem class regarding team comments on functionality

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- Continue working on the Mkdir class to be fully functional.
	- Start brainstorming possible test cases which my code may be tested on
	= Prepare for the demo presentation on June 29th

Am I blocked on anything?
	- The team is discussing creating a new design for some the CurrentWorkingDirectory class, which would impact my code signifcantly.
	- Cannot continue to develop and implement my Mkdir class design without its supporting classes
	- Testing of the Mkdir class requires other functions, ie, LS, CD, etc.
