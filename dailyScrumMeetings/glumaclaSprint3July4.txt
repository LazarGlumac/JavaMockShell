What did I work on in the last three days
	- Refactored FileSystem code to follow the Singleton principle.
	- Created factory method to instantiate the FileSystem.
	- Implemented the Singleton FileSystem design to all classes that require the FileSystem
	- Added missing Javadoc comments to methods.

What do I plan to work in the next three days
	- Show test cases in comments of the functions that I worked on.
	- Ensure my code holds up to the Google Code Style Guide.
	- Add missing Javadoc comments to classes.

Am I blocked on anything
