What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Worked on File, Directory, Speak, and Voice classes. 

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Finish File and Directory to fully collaborate with FileSystem.
    - Adjust the implementation for Voice which deals with the type of text being converted to speech. 
    - Continue distributing tasks among my group members to implement the User Stories.

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Need a functional FileSystem (such as a working prototype) to test File and Directory for bugs or additional add-ons.
