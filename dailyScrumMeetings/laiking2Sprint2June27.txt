    - Fixed issue with the speak command where some of the words entered by the user
      weren't being spoken.
    - Implemented the ability to store a Directory object in the CurrentWorkingDirectory.
    - Worked on and revised Cd, and DirectoryStack classes based on the new implementation above.

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Fixing the Mbrola error that occurs when running the speak command.

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Not at the moment.
