What did I work on in the last three days?
	- Re-wrote the Speak class to follow the guidelines Sally and Abbas set on Microsoft Teams.
	- Removed the Voice class as it was unnecessary and could be easily implemented into Speak.
	- Added commenting on the methods I worked on.
	- Cleaned up the Cd class to be more concise.

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Add Javadoc for the class I worked on (Cd, Pushd, Popd, Speak, DirectoryStack, File,
      Directory, CurrentWorkingDirectory, FilePath).
    - Add relevant returns for the command I worked on.
    - Run various tests on our code.

Am I blocked on anything?
    - I need to add relevant returns for the commands I worked on in order to run tests on them properly.
