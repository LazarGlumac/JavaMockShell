What did I work on in the last three days
	- Added Junit testing for the Mv, Cp, Find, Popd, Pushd, and Cd.
	- Edited any classes I worked on to be more precise and to meet the 30 line limit.
	
What do I plan to work in the next three days
	- Continuing running tests on our program to look for any unseen bugs.
	- Write Junit tests for the non-command classes I worked on:
	  - Directory
	  - File
	  - FilePath
	
Am I blocked on anything
	- Not at the moment.
