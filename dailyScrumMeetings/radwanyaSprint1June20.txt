hat did I work on in the last three days?
    - Created and completed all CRC cards
    - Worked on Man class 

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Start working on the rest of the classes (my specific class responsibilities will be determined in our next Sprint meeting)

Am I blocked on anything?
    - In order to properly test my Man class, the Validation and Command classes must be completed with full functionality
