What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Completed the Exit class and updated Man class to reflect the new changes to our Echo class structure
    - Performed a mock demo with the entire team to make sure all our completed classes function properly
    - Worked on Cat and Pwd command classes

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Complete Cat and Pwd command classes
    - Update our CRC cards to reflect our current design
    - Prepare and host another Mock Demo to ensure our currently functional classes produce the correct output for all possible cases

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Need CurrentWorkingDirectory to be completed (and functional) before I can complete Pwd class
