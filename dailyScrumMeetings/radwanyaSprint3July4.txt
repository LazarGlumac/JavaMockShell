What did I work on in the last three days
	- Added Javadoc and comments to Pwd, Cat, Exit, Man command classes
        - Formatted and edited my code to ensure it follows all the guidelines
          from the rubric(eg. Making sure all my methods did not exceed 30 lines
          each, adhering to Google Code Style, etc...)
        - Continued to test and debug my code to ensure everything works properly

What do I plan to work in the next three days
	- Show test cases in comments of the functions that I worked on
        - Finish updating/creating all CRC cards to reflect our current (and 
          final design)

Am I blocked on anything
	- Not anymore~!
