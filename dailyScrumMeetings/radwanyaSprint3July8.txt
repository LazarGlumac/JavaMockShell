What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Changed the design of man and updated all classes to follow the new
    design: instead of man containing all command descriptions,
    each command class has its own method that contains all info about it
    - Made sure all my classes follow all style guidelines and added javadocs
    and comments to all my classes as well
    - Updated all the CRC cards (including adding/deleting old CRC cards)
    to reflect our current (and final) design

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - N/A

Am I blocked on anything?
    - N/A
