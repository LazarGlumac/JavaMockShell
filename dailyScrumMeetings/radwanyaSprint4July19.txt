What did I work on in the last three days
	- Started working on the new implementation of Cat
        - Added CRC cards for the new command classes and modified the existing ones to include the new features

What do I plan to work in the next three days
	- Complete the Cat command
	- Modify the Man command to include the new commands created in A2B
        - Complete the CRC cards

Am I blocked on anything
	- Need all the new classes to be semi-completed in order to update the CRC cards accordingly
